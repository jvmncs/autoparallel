study specs/* to learn about the library specifications and fix_plan.md to understand plan so far.

The source code of the library is in src/*. Study them

First task is to study @fix_plan.md (it may be incorrect) and is to use up to 500 parallel subagents to study existing source code in src/ and compare it against the library specifications (check current num files before you launch them). From that, create/update a @fix_plan.md which is a bullet point list sorted in priority of the items which have yet to be implemeneted. Think extra hard and use the oracle to plan. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations and placeholders. Study @fix_plan.md to determine starting point for research and keep it up to date with items considered complete/incomplete using subagents.

Second task is to use up to 500 subagents to study existing source code in examples/ then compare it against the library specifications. From that create/update a fix_plan.md which is a bullet point list sorted in priority of the items which have yet to be implemeneted. Think extra hard and use the oracle to plan. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations and placeholders. Study fix_plan.md to determine starting point for research and keep it up to date with items considered complete/incomplete.
