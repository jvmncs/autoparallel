# Future Ideas and Stretch Goals

This document captures potential future enhancements for the AutoParallel library that go beyond the current specifications.

## Advanced Optimization Features

### Multi-Model Comparison
**Description**: Compare multiple models side-by-side for deployment decisions
```python
def compare_models(
    models: List[str], 
    cluster: ClusterConfig
) -> ComparisonReport:
    # Memory requirements comparison
    # Performance predictions across models
    # Deployment cost analysis
    # Resource utilization efficiency
```

**Value**: Help users choose between different model options for their use case and hardware constraints.

## Implementation Notes

These ideas are not part of the current implementation plan but could be valuable future enhancements. They should be considered after the core functionality is stable and validated in production.

Each idea would require:
- Detailed specification and design
- User research to validate demand
- Technical feasibility analysis
- Integration planning with existing architecture
